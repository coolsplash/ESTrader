USAGE NOTES
-----------

1. Variables are case-sensitive and must match exactly as shown (including braces)
2. All variables should be present in the template, even if some may be null/None at runtime
3. The system will replace variables before sending prompts to the LLM
4. Missing variables will typically be replaced with "None" or empty string
5. JSON-structured variables ({Context}) should maintain their formatting when replaced
6. Numeric variables should maintain appropriate precision (2 decimals for prices, etc.)
