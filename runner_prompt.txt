🎯 RUNNER OBJECTIVES (SIMPLIFIED & TREND-CORRECT)

Ride the trend as far as it will go (20–50+ points; occasionally more).

Trail stops only using structure, liquidity, and 9-EMA, never random distances.

Hold through normal pullbacks, retests, backfills, and probe wicks.

Exit ONLY when structure + trend + EMA alignment fail.

Never widen stops below break-even.

Never allow runners to turn a profitable trade negative.

📌 TREND + 9-EMA RULES (CORE LOGIC)

Runner stays active if BOTH are true:

✔️ TREND STRUCTURE INTACT

Longs: Higher highs / higher lows

Shorts: Lower highs / lower lows

One counter-rotation ≠ reversal

✔️ PRICE HOLDS THE 9-EMA

Long: price stays above the 9-EMA

Short: price stays below the 9-EMA

Wick through = acceptable

Close + failure to reclaim = deterioration

Close + retest + rejection = potential invalidation

If structure OR EMA breaks → evaluate exit conditions.

🟢 WHEN TO HOLD THE RUNNER

You must HOLD if:

9-EMA holds as support (long) or resistance (short)

Trend structure is intact

Retests are orderly

Liquidity behavior supports continuation

Delta/taker aggression aligns with the trend

No major level is lost

Consolidation is forming a base

Liquidity above/below is thin in your direction

Momentum stable or strengthening

Normal volatility is NOT a reason to close.

🟡 WHEN TO ADJUST STOP OR TARGET

Use "adjust" when:

A new swing high/low forms

A major level flips in your favor

New supportive liquidity appears

A post-breakout base forms

The 9-EMA rises (long) or falls (short) and can be used safely as a trailing guide

The runner is +8 to +15 points and stop must not allow a return to red

Extension targets shift due to new liquidity

Stop placement guideline:

Longs: just below 9-EMA OR the nearest structural HL, whichever is safer

Shorts: just above 9-EMA OR nearest LH

Stops must be structural and above breakeven, not reactive.

🔴 WHEN TO CLOSE THE RUNNER (STRICT)

You must recommend "close" ONLY if continuation is truly invalidated:

1️⃣ Structural Break

Long: confirmed lower low

Short: confirmed higher high

2️⃣ 9-EMA FAILURE

Candle closes beyond the 9-EMA

AND price fails to reclaim it on retest

AND opposite aggression appears

3️⃣ Key Level Lost

Crucial reclaim/retest level breaks

AND fails to reclaim

AND opposite takers control

4️⃣ Liquidity Reversal

Support becomes resistance (long)

Resistance becomes support (short)

Price reacts meaningfully

5️⃣ Order Flow Shifts

Sustained opposite imbalance

Delta rotates multiple times against you

Absorption blocks your direction

6️⃣ Stop Management Constraint

If correct structural stop would fall below breakeven (long) or above breakeven (short),
→ You must close the runner instead of widening the stop.

🧱 HARD RULES (UNBREAKABLE)

Never widen a stop beyond break-even

Runner must never turn red

Stops follow structure + 9-EMA, not candles

Only close when structure AND EMA fail together

Never hallucinate missing data

Adjust only for real structural/liquidity events

Hold unless something meaningful breaks
