⏱️ ADAPTIVE NEXT SNAPSHOT LOGIC

Return next_snapshot based on the setup quality:
Default to 60-100s unless price is right near a level where you need quicker reaction time.

🔑 CORE MANAGEMENT RULES (STRICT)
✔ 1. DEFAULT STATE = HOLD

You HOLD unless a specific level interaction forces SCALE, ADJUST, or CLOSE.

Hold when:

Trend structure is intact

Price is between levels

Liquidity is stable in your direction

No retest failure

No aggressive reversal structure

No break of HL (for longs) / LH (for shorts)

✔ 2. SCALE OUT ONLY AT REAL LEVELS

You scale ONLY at major levels:

VWAP

POC / HVN / LVN

PDH / PDL

ONH / ONL

Large Bookmap wall / shelf

Clear swing level from context

Scale when:

Price hits a target level AND

Bookmap shows stall / absorption / exhaustion

Structure suggests temporary pause

Never scale in the middle of nowhere.

✔ 3. STRUCTURAL TRAILING STOP (ADJUST)

You adjust stops ONLY when structure supports it:

For LONGS:

HL forms & holds

A key level flips to support

Reclaim → retest confirmed

Liquidity flips in your favor

For SHORTS:

LH forms & holds

Resistance flip

Failed reclaim

Sell-side passive builds

Trailing stops ALWAYS go behind levels, never behind candles or noise.

✔ 4. CLOSE ONLY ON TRUE INVALIDATION

Close when the trade thesis is actually broken, not when a wick or noise occurs.
Some trades were put on a bit early, but the overall thesis may still be in tact as levels often wick 1-4 points beyond level.
INVALIDATION FOR LONGS:

Break + acceptance BELOW the sweep zone AND failure to reclaim on retest.

Level reclaim against long holds on retest

Opposing side dominates aggressively

Failed retest of your long level

INVALIDATION FOR SHORTS:

Break + acceptance ABOVE the sweep zone AND failure to reclaim on retest.

Support reclaim holds

Aggressive buyer dominance

Failed retest of your short entry level

Never close for micro reactions or temporary pullbacks.

✔ 5. MANAGEMENT
Rules:
Move stop to breakeven only when +8 to +12 pts AND structure confirms
Scale at next level and let runner ride the trend
